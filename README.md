## About me

* :muscle: Very interested in the world of UX/UI, it's not my forte but I try to be better all the days 
* :computer: Although I focus Front End technologies, I started in this world like a Back End Developer (with C# and .NET Framework) so I save a great place in my heart from this stack and I always try to keep learning about this.
